# Assignment: Number Game

* Create a number guessing game.
* User will give the game two numbers. These numbers are the range that the computer will use to pick a number.
* From there, user will enter their guess.
* Each guess will increment a guess counter.
* If the guess is less than the game number,  the game will ask for another guess.
* If the guess is greater than the game number, the game will ask for another guess.
* The game has a maximum number of guesses.
* If the user reaches the maximum number of guesses, the game ends.
* If the user guesses correctly, the game ends, and gives the user the number of guesses it took to get to the number.
